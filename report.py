#Regression analysis
## X is the input variables (or independent variables)
X = boston_df['DIS']
## y is the target/dependent variable
y = boston_df['MEDV']
## add an intercept (beta_0) to our model
X = sm.add_constant(X) 

model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
predictions = model.predict(X)

# Print out the statistics
model.summary()


# **Conclusion:** Like the t-test, the p-value is less than the alpha (Î±) level = 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis as there is evidence that there is a difference in mean evaluation scores based on gender. The coefficient 1.0916 means that MEDV get 1.0916 higher as the DIS increases one unit.
